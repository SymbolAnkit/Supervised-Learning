## Bias-Variance Trade-off

1.Bias
2.Variance
3.Irreducible error

### Irreducible Error

noise is irreducible error
* Data-generating processes are noisy
* Noise is by definition random(not deterministic)
* Can't predict its values, only its statistics (Like mean & variance)


### Bias 

Error in the model is bias
Bias = E[f(x) - f^(x)]

### Variance
* Varinace from statistics = ow much a random varibale deviates from its mean in squared units
* Variance in the context of bias-variance trade-off is more specific
* Variance = Statistical variance of predictor over all possible training sets
* Example - Suppose we have a model that overfits - gets perfect for any training set then the models for each training set are probably very different from each other
